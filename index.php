       <p id ="abouttxt"> Welcome! </P> 
       <P id="aboutme">
       Hello! My name is Anna Selonick. I am junior at Northwestern University, majoring in Computer Science with a certificate in Design. My focuses are in Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. 
  <br/><br/>
      My freshman year at Northwestern I joined Design for America (DFA),
      an organization that seeks to make positive social and environmental 
      impact using the human-center design process. Working in teams of five to six people, 
      DFA members attempt to design solutions within the areas of Education, Health, and the Environment. 
      This experience has profoundly affected my goals and interests as a student. 
      I am not only passionate about programming, but also design and social change. 
      I want to write code that matters. I plan to pursue a career that allows me to understand my users, 
      and write code that will have a positive impact on their lives.
  <br/> <br/> <br/>

                <p class="blurbtext">Last spring, I competed in a robot competition with one other partner. The goal was to create a robot that could pick up 
                small objects in an arena and return them to a homebase. I designed and built the chassis for the robot as well as helped design 
                and debug the program we ran on the robot's PIC32.</p>
                <p class="blurbtext">This project challenged me to apply my background in Computer Science to another field, mechatronics, in which I did not 
                  have any previous experience. Simultaneously trying to create an efficient program, a sturdy mechanical design and a well-organized
                  electrical system to work together as one robot was great puzzle that I will never forget.
